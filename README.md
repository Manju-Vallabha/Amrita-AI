# Amrita-AI
### Transforming Waste Management with AI, Inspired by the Purity of ***Amrita*** to Foster a Sustainable Future

## 🌟 Project Overview

Amrita-AI is an innovative platform that uses Generative AI to classify waste and assess its environmental impact. The project aims to revolutionize waste management, providing insights into waste classification, recycling potential, and environmental harm, all while promoting a cleaner, sustainable future.

***Amrita***, in Sanskrit, symbolizes immortality, purity, and nectar, aligning beautifully with our goal of creating a cleaner, more sustainable world. It represents the life-giving power of nature, which resonates with the mission of our project to enhance environmental sustainability through innovative AI solutions.

Using cutting-edge technologies like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Vertex AI, the platform classifies waste observed on roads into categories like organic, e-waste, and recyclable. Beyond classification, it provides actionable insights such as:

- Whether the waste is harmful to the surroundings.
- Its potential for recycling and proper disposal methods.
